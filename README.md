# ModuleStudio Generator - MDSD for Zikula

ModuleStudio is a model-driven development environment with which one can quickly,
simply and efficiently describe and generate web applications. Create complex
modules in a few steps and meet individual project requirements with them.

The generated applications can be used with the [Zikula application framework](https://github.com/zikula/core/)
which is based on [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/).

Here is a screenshot showing how the user interface looks like:
